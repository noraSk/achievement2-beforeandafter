# achievement2-beforeandafter
### Attributions
- I mostly used the step by step instructions on sait's wbdv assignments website 
- I also used this website as a reference to one part of this achievement[this](https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_booleans.asp)
- I did not ask for any help from anyone(I want to do them myself)

### Code journal
- The easiest part of this achievement is obviously creating the repo and opening the js folder on vscode
- I found it easier to work on string and array than the other files.
- I understand the others too but I need to open a few websites as reference to create my own idea
- I think the part that I don't understand the most is boolean
- There are a lot of articles that show how to do the false option but doesn't really explain how i'm supposed to do the right one
- So I am a bit confused with that but I will understand it after watching a few more tutorials and doing more assignments.
- Besides boolean, there was not a lot struggling
- The instructions are pretty clear and straighforward and most importantly, it was fun
